### Paola V. Figueroa-Delgado, BS
  
## Short Biography

My name is Paola V. Figueroa Delgado, born and raised in a small town in Puerto Rico known for its amazing coffee. Curious to which? Ask, 
there might be coffee included. I am a molecular cellular biology undergraduate student participating under the Neuro-ID Research Program, 
a training NIH BP-ENDURE grant to increase diversity in neuroscience. Furthermore, I am currently the founder and president of the National
Neuroscience Student Association (NNSA). We aim to propel diversity and engagement in STEM by providing a mutlidisciplinary platform where
the academic and national community can interact and learn of neuroscience and its relevance. I believe it is important to communicate 
science and our achievements to the next-generation scientists and pioneers through educational experiences and activities that contribute
to their academic and personal development. In addition, I'm currently working at Dr. Garcia-Arrara's Developmental Neurobiology Laboratory researching on the relationship and/or role the nervous system has on intestinal regeneration via 
in vivo and in vitro studies. 

## Additional Need-To-Know Information

+ I am a very funny human, with the occasional hint of sarcasm. 
+ I am highly optimistic and focused. 
+ About 99% of the time, when asked how I am, I will be stressed. The other 1% I spend sleeping.
+ I will never turn down coffee. I will probably "turn down for what". (Google the reference if not understood) ;) 
+ I did archery (yes, I used an actual bow and arrow).
+ I'm relatively new to programming. All help is highly welcomed.
